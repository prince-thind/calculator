# Calculator

Calculator is a vanilla JS project that tries to mimic the functionality of a retro calculator. The JS logic of this project has been heavlily referenced from the approach used here in [this youtube tutotrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw). The CSS design of this project however, is completely original creation of mine.
